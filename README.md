# OpenWRT TeleBot

A modern Telegram automation toolkit for OpenWRT routers. The project ships a
lightweight Python bot, a responsive web control panel served through uhttpd,
and helper scripts for integrating with router events and shell plugins.

## Features

- **Robust Telegram bot** implemented in Python 3 with safe polling, logging and
  modular command dispatching.
- **Shell plugin framework** ‚Äì drop executable `*.sh` files into the plugins
  directory to expose router functionality as Telegram commands.
- **Beautiful web UI** hosted from uhttpd for real-time status, configuration
  editing, log inspection, plugin execution and manual chat messaging.
- **Self-healing installer** that works from an extracted release folder or
  downloads the latest ZIP automatically, deploys to `/opt/openwrt-telebot`, and
  refreshes the uhttpd assets so stale UI files disappear.
- **Event helpers** for DHCP and WAN notifications via Telegram.
- **Router-aware access control** that watches LAN clients, assigns each device a
  stable TeleBot ID, feeds nftables (and the OpenWRT firewall UI) until you
  approve them, and lets you approve, pause/resume, whitelist or forget devices
  from Telegram or the web dashboard without repeat nagging.
- **Optional rich Telegram formatting** with inline approval keyboards, sparkline
  graphs and emoji badges when you enable `enhanced_notifications` in the
  configuration.
- **Interactive Telegram menus** that surface a tap-first control centre, client
  pickers and quick actions so you rarely have to type identifiers by hand.

## Requirements

- OpenWRT 24.x (or similar BusyBox-based firmware)
- Python 3 (`opkg update && opkg install python3`)
- `curl` or `wget` plus `unzip` (for the installer)
- uhttpd web server (stock on OpenWRT)
- `nftables` (`opkg install nftables`) for client isolation and approval


## Quick install

1. Download the latest release archive from the
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sfdcai/openwrt-telegram/releases)
   page and extract it on the router (or a writable location).
2. Run the installer from inside the extracted directory:

   ```sh
   sh install.sh
   ```

   - Use `--target /custom/path` to override the installation prefix.
   - Use `--force-download` if you want the installer to fetch a fresh copy even
     though it is already running from an extracted archive.
   - Use `--source /path/to/archive.zip` to point the installer at a particular
     release bundle when operating offline.

3. Reload uhttpd so the refreshed assets and CGI script are active:

   ```sh
   /etc/init.d/uhttpd restart
   ```

The installer verifies tool availability, prepares nftables state, removes old
web assets before copying the new UI, preserves your existing `config.json`,
and reports the version that was installed.

To update in-place, run the same command again ‚Äì the script detects its current
location and only downloads the release if needed.

## Manual setup

If you prefer manual deployment:

```sh
mkdir -p /opt/openwrt-telebot/{bot,config,plugins,helpers,events,init.d}
# copy files from this repo into /opt/openwrt-telebot with the same layout
chmod +x /opt/openwrt-telebot/bot/main.py
chmod +x /opt/openwrt-telebot/plugins/*.sh
chmod +x /opt/openwrt-telebot/helpers/tele-notify
cp /opt/openwrt-telebot/init.d/openwrt-telebot /etc/init.d/openwrt-telebot
chmod +x /etc/init.d/openwrt-telebot
```

Serve the UI by copying `www/index.html`, `www/assets`, and
`www/cgi-bin/telebot.py` into `/www/telebot` and `/www/cgi-bin` respectively.

## Configuration

Edit `/opt/openwrt-telebot/config/config.json`:

- `bot_token` ‚Äì Telegram bot token from BotFather.
- `chat_id_default` ‚Äì Default chat ID for outbound notifications.
- `poll_timeout` ‚Äì Long polling timeout in seconds.
- `plugins_dir` ‚Äì Directory containing executable shell plugins.
- `log_file` ‚Äì Log output file for the bot.
- `ui_api_token` ‚Äì Optional token required by the web UI API. Leave it blank to
  disable authentication or set a secret string and store it in the browser via
  the UI access panel.
- `ui_base_url` ‚Äì Preferred base URL for the UI (informational).
- `version_endpoint` ‚Äì URL used by the dashboard to determine the latest
  available release (defaults to the GitHub Releases API).
- `version_cache_ttl` ‚Äì How long, in seconds, the remote version lookup is
  cached before refreshing.
- `client_state_file` ‚Äì JSON file that stores discovered clients and their
  approval status (defaults to `state/clients.json`).
- `nft_table` / `nft_chain` ‚Äì nftables objects that TeleBot manages to block
  unapproved MAC addresses on the forward hook.
- `nft_block_set` / `nft_allow_set` / `nft_internet_block_set` ‚Äì nftables sets
  holding fully blocked, approved and WAN-only-blocked MAC addresses.
- `wan_interfaces` ‚Äì Comma-separated list of WAN interface names used when
  applying WAN-only client blocks.
- `client_whitelist` ‚Äì List of MAC addresses that bypass approval entirely.
- `firewall_include_path` / `firewall_include_section` ‚Äì Where the generated
  nftables include is stored and how it is registered with `uci` so the
  TeleBot rule appears under **Network ‚Üí Firewall**.
- `enhanced_notifications` ‚Äì Set to `true` (default) to send HTML-formatted
  Telegram messages with icons, device cards and status graphs.
- `notification_schedule` ‚Äì Optional list of `HH:MM` entries (router local
  time) that triggers a scheduled status digest in the default chat.

Use the built-in web UI to manage these fields securely ‚Äì token values are
masked when displayed and only updated when explicitly changed. The bot accepts
messages only from the configured default chat ID, so make sure it matches your
personal conversation with the bot.

When `ui_api_token` is set, paste the same value into the dashboard's **API
token** field and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click **Save token**. The UI stores
the value locally and automatically retries it after unauthorized responses. You
can also append `?token=YOUR_TOKEN` to the dashboard URL for quick access on new
devices.

Once authenticated, the header displays the installed version, the latest
release detected online, and a colour-coded badge that highlights when an update
is available.

### Enhanced Telegram notifications

Enhanced formatting is enabled by default and can be toggled from the web UI.
When active, the bot renders replies with emoji headers, HTML emphasis, compact
tables, and inline graphs. Disable the switch (or set
`"enhanced_notifications": false`) if you prefer plain-text responses for
maximum compatibility.

### Scheduled digests

Provide a comma-separated list of `HH:MM` slots in the **Scheduled digests**
field of the UI (or via `notification_schedule` in `config.json`) to receive a
daily router summary. Each slot fires once per day in the router's timezone and
delivers the same rich output as `/status` and `/router` combined.

## Running the bot

```
/etc/init.d/openwrt-telebot enable
/etc/init.d/openwrt-telebot start
```

The service uses `procd` for supervision. Logs are written to the path defined
in `config.json`.

### Telegram commands

The dispatcher responds to the following built-in commands:

- `/menu` ‚Äì open the interactive control centre with status tiles and quick actions.
- `/ping` ‚Äì heartbeat check.
- `/status` ‚Äì core system information.
- `/plugins` ‚Äì list executable shell plugins.
- `/run <plugin> [args]` ‚Äì run a plugin (admin-only for critical scripts).
- `/log [lines]` ‚Äì tail the bot log.
- `/whoami` ‚Äì echo your Telegram identifiers.
- `/clients` ‚Äì browse clients with inline navigation and one-tap action buttons.
- `/router` ‚Äì summarise approval counts and nftables health.
- `/approve <id|mac|ip>` ‚Äì approve a pending or blocked client.
- `/block <id|mac|ip> [internet|network]` ‚Äì block WAN-only or the entire network for a client.
- `/pause <id|mac|ip>` ‚Äì temporarily suspend internet access for a device.
- `/resume <id|mac|ip>` ‚Äì restore a paused device to the approved list.
- `/whitelist <id|mac|ip>` ‚Äì permanently allow a client.
- `/forget <id|mac>` ‚Äì remove a client from the registry.
- `/diag` ‚Äì run the bundled diagnostics report directly from chat.

Every approved device receives a stable identifier such as `C0007`. Use that ID
in commands and the inline buttons to avoid typing MAC addresses from your
phone. Commands like `/approve`, `/block`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/whitelist` and
`/forget` now present an inline selector when you omit the identifier so you can
confirm the target visually before actioning it.

## Web UI

Visit `http://<router-ip>/telebot/`. If an API token is configured the page will
highlight the token field until a valid value is saved. The control panel allows
you to:

- Inspect bot process status, uptime and disk usage.
- Update Telegram credentials and bot configuration.
- Send test messages or arbitrary messages to specific chats.
- Run shell plugins and view their output instantly.
- Tail recent log entries.
- Review LAN devices with their TeleBot IDs, choose WAN-only or full-network
  blocks, pause/resume internet access, approve or reject new clients, and
  maintain a whitelist that is never blocked.

### Client approval workflow

- When a new MAC address appears on the LAN it is added to the `blocked`
  nftables set and shown as **Pending** in the dashboard.
- TeleBot sends a Telegram notification with the device hostname, TeleBot ID and
  inline buttons so you can approve, block, pause or whitelist the device
  directly from chat. Enable `enhanced_notifications` to add HTML cards and a
  quick client status graph to that message.
- Use `/clients` or `/menu ‚Üí Clients` to browse pending devices with paginated
  inline buttons. The same selector appears when you run `/approve`, `/block`,
  `/pause`, `/resume`, `/whitelist` or `/forget` without arguments so you can
  confirm the target before applying a change.
- `/block` now presents two buttons: **üåêüö´ Block internet** limits WAN access by
  dropping packets headed to the configured WAN interfaces while keeping LAN
  reachability intact, and **‚õî Block network** isolates the device entirely.
  Configure the WAN interface list under **WAN interfaces** in the web UI to
  suit your topology (e.g. `wan, wan6, pppoe-wan`).
- The web UI mirrors the same controls and shows live connection/"last seen"
  data pulled from DHCP leases and `ip neigh`.
- Approving a client removes it from the block list, pausing moves it to a
  temporary deny set, whitelisting marks it as always allowed, and forgetting a
  device clears it from the registry. Once you take action the bot remembers the
  decision and will not alert you about that device again unless you remove it.

All operations are logged to the configured log file, and the CGI/UI layer will
report errors back to the browser while appending stack traces to the log for
easy troubleshooting.

### Firewall integration

The router controller now writes an nftables include file (default
`/etc/nftables.d/telebot.nft`) and registers it through `uci` as
`firewall.telebot_include`. The include is automatically marked `enabled`,
applies to `family any`, and the firewall service is reloaded so LuCI displays
it under **Network ‚Üí Firewall** immediately. Adjust the path or section name in
`config.json` if you prefer a different location.

### Logs and troubleshooting

- Default log path: `/var/log/openwrt-telebot.log` (customisable via
  `config.json`). View it from the dashboard, `/log` command or BusyBox `tail`.
- The CGI script also logs to the same file; UI authentication failures now
  include the requesting IP address and hints for correcting the token.
- Run the diagnostics helper either from SSH (`python3 scripts/diagnostics.py`)
  or Telegram (`/diag`) to validate services, nftables, web UI deployment and
  API authentication in one step.

### Recommended enhancements

- **UCI-driven profiles:** map TeleBot roles to OpenWrt UCI sections so specific
  WLANs, DHCP pools or VPN instances can be toggled per profile directly from
  Telegram, keeping configuration drift minimal.
- **Per-device history export:** persist recent activity snapshots (approval
  changes, WAN/LAN transitions, alerts triggered) so operators can download a
  CSV audit trail from the web UI.
- **Service health hooks:** integrate with lightweight monitoring (e.g. `ubus`
  stats) to auto-restart WAN, DNS or AdGuard services when TeleBot notices
  repeated failures, with backoff and chat notifications.
- Use `/router` to confirm client counts and nftables availability without
  leaving Telegram.
- `/router` now also reports the firewall include status so you can confirm the
  rule is visible under **Network ‚Üí Firewall**, while `scripts/diagnostics.py`
  prints the include attributes for quick verification.

### Diagnose issues quickly

Run the bundled diagnostic helper to capture configuration, service status,
`nftables` health and web UI deployment details in a single report:

```sh
python3 scripts/diagnostics.py --config /opt/openwrt-telebot/config/config.json
```

Use the output to verify paths, confirm the init scripts are installed, and
spot missing nftables sets or stale web assets without digging through multiple
commands.

## Helpers and events

- `helpers/tele-notify` ‚Äì Shell helper to send quick messages using the bot
  configuration.
- `events/10-dhcp-notify.sh` ‚Äì Example hook for DHCP lease notifications.
- `events/20-wan-iface.sh` ‚Äì Example WAN state notification hook (edit for your
  environment).

## Development

- Run the bot once with a custom config file:
  `python3 bot/main.py --config ./config/config.json --once`
- Validate Python files: `python3 -m py_compile bot/*.py www/cgi-bin/telebot.py`
- Preview the UI locally: `scripts/preview_server.py --port 8081` and browse to
  <http://127.0.0.1:8081/>.
- Capture environment health: `python3 scripts/diagnostics.py`.

Pull requests are welcome ‚Äì see the source for additional details.
### Generate a release ZIP locally

If you want to create the same archive that GitHub serves (for testing or to
host it privately), use:

```sh
scripts/package_release.sh
```

The script writes `openwrt-telegram-<version>.zip` in the repository root. Pass
`--output /tmp/custom.zip` to change the destination.

Update the `VERSION` file before packaging so the installer and UI report the
correct release number.
